# Create Questions Dialogs with Java
This program creates <b>multiple choice and True/False questions</b> using the _JOptionPane_ class as the GUI. The program asks for answers for a user to fill. The final score is returned after answering all questions. This program can be implemented in performing online exams or surveys.

There are four classes in this project.
- _MultipleChoiceQuestion.java_ is a class file to manage multiple-choice questions.
- _TrueFalseQuestion.java_ is a class file to manage true/false questions.
- _Question.java_ is a parent class of the above two classes.
- _QuestionDialog.java_ is a button-listener class.
- _Quiz.java_ will include the main program.

You have to put your questions and answers in the file _Quiz.java_.
